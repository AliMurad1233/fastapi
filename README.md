# First-FastAPI-Project

## A Quick Walk Through The Project

### Description
FastAPI is fast web framework used for building APIs, I went with it because it's easy to use and it provides automatic data validation and documentation. This FastAPI project written in Python provides APIs for uploading,training a logistic regression model and saving it, showing the progress of the training phase and listing all the models saved. This process only works with (csv,xlsx,xls) extensions
